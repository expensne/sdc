# TS/SDC

This project is a simple implementation of a car simulation game (based on [Radu Mariescu-Istodor](https://www.youtube.com/@Radu) project) in TypeScript. The game uses an evolutionary algorithm to evolve the AI of the cars over time.

Purpose of this project is to learn TypeScript the fun way. Still a lot of todo's!

## Installation
To install the project, clone the repository and run `npm install`.

## Usage
To start the game, open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Ideas / Todo

- try: https://piqnt.com/planck.js / https://box2d.org for physics
- parenting for evolution
- node + electron (better performance for faster training)
- tensorflow
